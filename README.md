# Eye-in-Hand-Calibration 
============

Calibration Algorithms was developed by Yu-Shiang Yan.<br>
it was designed on Eye-In-Hand robot arm<br>
the algorithms was assembled by two major parts:
<ul>
  <li>Camera calibration</li>
  Calculate by chessboard pattern<br>
  Calculate intrinsic parameters and extrinsic parameters<br>
  To calibrate the lens distortion and get the projection matrix.
  <li>Hand-eye calibration</li>
  Calculate by Tsai method<br>
  To calibrate from eye to hand and get homography matrix<br>
</ul> 
<br>
following are the quick start steps:
<ol>
  <li>build libVision.so </li>
  <li>build UnitestVision</li>
  <li>execute UnitestVision</li>
  <li>now you are good to go!</li>
</ol>
